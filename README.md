## Credits

- At first I wanted to practice Javascript with coding a few quizzes as I belive repetition and practice is one of better ways to advance skills so I followed a coder provided in the link below and finally created this webpage, so here is a link to my [repository](https://github.com/totalnoMartina/vegan-quiz)

- The code that helped me make this quiz layout was found on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY)

- Linear-gradient on my background and buttons are inspired by Wes, creator of JavaScript 30 projects in 30 days, and here is the [link](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/61570d96e15af66ceff732ec/view/194129583) to the project which inspired me.
